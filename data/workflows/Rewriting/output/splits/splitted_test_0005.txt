{"type": "text", "content": "To understand exactly how to group the data, which were otherwise quite scattered and disordered, requires some simple reasoning: it\u2019s not a problem that an LLM could solve simply by regurgitating something that approximates the language it has seen. GPT4 has certainly observed similar programs during its training, but almost certainly has not seen a program that had to group things in the exact way I asked for and in a CSV file with that specific format. This shows (in my opinion) that LLMs can interpolate to some extent within the space outlined by the different programs in the training set."}
