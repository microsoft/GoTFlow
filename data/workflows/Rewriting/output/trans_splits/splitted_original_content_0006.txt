{"type": "text", "content": "The implementation produced by GPT4 is not exactly brilliant. Bloom filters are quite widespread. It\u2019s not such an exotic data structure. However, it\u2019s clear that writing a decent bloom filter requires a greater capacity for abstraction: for example, there\u2019s the problem of finding an effective way to hash the same string N times, and being certain that the hashes are sufficiently decorrelated.\nYet if you explicitly ask GPT4 to modify the hashing function so that it produces N decorrelated outputs, its proposed solution is significantly more acceptable:\n"}
