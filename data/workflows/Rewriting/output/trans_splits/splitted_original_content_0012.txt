{"type": "text", "content": "Sora is a diffusion model; given input noisy patches (and conditioning information like text prompts), it\u2019s trained to predict the original \u201cclean\u201d patches. Importantly, Sora is a diffusion transformer. Transformers have demonstrated remarkable scaling properties across a variety of domains, including language modeling, computer vision and image generation."}
