{"type": "text", "content": "Sora currently exhibits numerous limitations as a simulator. For example, it does not accurately model the physics of many basic interactions, like glass shattering. Other interactions, like eating food, do not always yield correct changes in object state. We enumerate other common failure modes of the model\u2014such as incoherencies that develop in long duration samples or spontaneous appearances of objects\u2014in our landing page."}
